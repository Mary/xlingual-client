##Herein lies:
* JS React/Redux code for communication with the server end points
* An app made for creating/storing words for the user's benefit
* A 'Browse Global' aspect that allows for the app's use to be more dynamic, allowing you to learn new words from different languages.

##How to use app:
* Use Demo credentials: username: demo password demo123456 || Register
* You will automatically be logged in.
* Returning users with expired AuthTokens must log in
* Browse for globally available words in supported languages
* View information about specific words
* Add words, selecting global allows other users to see the word.
* View My List of self-owned words (global or non global)
* View information about specific owned words 
* Delete specific words

##Plans for the future:
* Fix CSS issues 
* Adding tooltip for "Global" 
* Fixing issues syncing in fetch/propogation of data
